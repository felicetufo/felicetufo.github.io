I’ve been working with C, C++ and Assembly languages for embedded resource-constrained projects, but also with C# and Python for desktop and web applications. I’ve coded both on Windows and Linux based platforms, and also used embedded real time OSes such as VxWorks. </p><h4>Cybersecurity</h4><p>During my career, I’ve been involved in risk analyses and vulnerability assessments; worked with application architects to ensure that security best practices and internal requirements were met through the entire development lifecycle; performed threat modeling, design reviews and code reviews with a focus on security as part of the development lifecycle. </p><h4>Processes And Standards</h4><p>I’ve been working for quite a few years in highly regulated industries, especially those adopting the IEC 62304 standard for medical devices. I have a thorough knowledge of the V cycle and understand its tailoring to specific industry contexts. I also had some exposure to ISO 26262 standard for automotive applications.</p><h4>Education</h4><p>I hold a five-years degree in "Computer Science And Engineering" obtained from the University of Bologna back in 2006 with full marks and honours. I also earned in 2021 a postgraduate degree (Italian "Master“) in <a href="sioi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"Strategic homeland defense: threat intelligence, big data and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure“</a>&nbsp;from SIOI. Other training courses I have attended can be found on my <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/felice-tufo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credly</a>&nbsp;profile. <p><h4>Soft skills</h4><p><i>What type of work environment do you prefer? When you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized? How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations? Do you prefer working independently or on a team? </i><br>These and many more answers about my personality, assessed by <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/7367894d3a1f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16 personalities</a>. </p><p>For a detailed curriculum and happy clients' recommendations, take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felicetufo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkedin</a>&nbsp;profile (and please feel free to connect) or <a href="#mail">get in touch!</a></p><h2>How I work</h2><p>I usually work from my office in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bologna</a>, using the technologies that best suit my clients to keep in touch with them and going on-site only when it's really necessary. I'm also open to consider an hybrid model. <p>Whenever possible, I prefer to work with a fixed-price contract: since a thorough analysis of the requirements is needed before starting, this type of contract makes it possible to optimize costs and time, being both the client and I focused on the project goals from the beginning. I'll listen to the specific needs and requirements of your project, analyze them and establish a delivery date (or multiple milestones). If you don't have clear requirements or feel like they can change along the way, that's ok too: let's split the long-term project into smaller short-term projects and prioritize them, beginning to work on known knowns.</p><p>I can also work under a time and material contract: in this case I usually propose a hourly rate, which may vary depending on a number of factors such as the project duration, the requested time commitment, the responsibilities, etc.</p><h2>Get in touch!</h2><p>Still unsure?
