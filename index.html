    <h1>Hi, I'm Felice!</h1>
  </header>

  <p>I'm a freelance software engineer and cybersecurity consultant, with over 20 years' experience in designing and
    developing safe and secure software. With my work, I help companies implement reliable systems.</p>

  <p>If you need to expand your internal software development team for a project that is falling behind schedule, or
    you're starting from scratch and looking for an experienced consultant that can assist you from requirements
    elicitation to product release, <a href="#mail">get in touch!</a></p>
  <h2>My skills</h2>

  <h3>Software Design and Development</h3>

  <p>I have more than 20 years of experience in software design and development, starting from requirements elicitation,
    to software architectural and behavioural modeling with UML, down to programming and testing. I’ve been working with
    C, C++ and Assembly languages for embedded resource-constrained projects, but also with C# and Python for
    desktop and web applications. I’ve coded both on Windows and Linux based platforms, and also used embedded real time
    OS such as VxWorks. I regularly use tools such as SonarQube, Lint and unit testing frameworks for maximum code
    quality.
  </p>

  <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

  <p>During my career, I’ve been involved in risk analyses and vulnerability assessments; worked with application
    architects to ensure that security best practices and internal requirements were met through the entire development
    lifecycle; performed threat modeling, design reviews and code reviews with a focus on security as part of the
    development lifecycle. I hold a postgraduate degree (Italian "Master“) in <em>"Strategic homeland defense: threat
      intelligence, big data and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure“</em>.</p>

  <h3>Processes And Standards</h3>

  <p>I’ve been working for quite a few years in highly regulated industries, especially those adopting the IEC 62304
    standard
    for medical devices. I have a thorough knowledge of the V cycle and understand its tailoring to specific industry
    contexts.
    I also had some exposure to ISO 26262 standard for automotive applications.</p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>

  <p>I usually work from my office in Bologna, using the technologies that best suit my clients to keep in touch
    with them and going on-site only when it's really necessary. I'm also open to consider an hybrid model.

  <p>Whenever possible, I prefer to work with a fixed-price contract: since a thorough analysis of the requirements is
    needed before starting, this type of contract makes it possible to optimize costs and time, being both the client
    and I focused on the project goals from the beginning. I'll listen to the specific needs and requirements of your
    project, analyze them and establish a delivery date (or multiple milestones). If you don't have clear requirements
    or feel like they can change along the way, that's ok too: let's split the long-term project into smaller short-term
    projects and prioritize them, beginning to work on known knowns.</p>

  <p>I can also work under a time and material contract: in this case I usually propose a hourly rate, which may vary
    depending on a number of factors such as the project duration, the requested time commitment, the responsibilities,
    etc.</p>
