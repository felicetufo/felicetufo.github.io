<h1>Hi, I'm Felice!</h1>

<p>I'm a freelance software engineer and cybersecurity consultant, with over 20 years' experience in designing and developing safe and secure software. With my work, I help companies implement reliable systems.</p>

<p>If you need to expand your internal software development team for a project that is falling behind schedule, or you're starting from scratch and looking for an experienced consultant that can assist you from requirements elicitation to product release, <a href="mailto:info@felicetufo.com">get in touch!</a></p>

<h2>My skills</h2>

<h3>Software Design and Development</h3>

<p>I have more than 20 years of experience in software design and development, starting from requirements elicitation, to software architectural and behavioural modeling with UML, down to programming and testing. I’ve been working with C, C++ and Assembly languages for embedded resource-constrained projects, but also with Java, C# and Python for desktop and web applications. I’ve coded both on Windows and Linux based platforms, and also used embedded real time OS such as VxWorks and FreeRTOS. I regularly use tools such as SonarQube, Lint and xUnit testing frameworks, for maximum code quality.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

<p>During my career, I’ve been involved in risk analyses and vulnerability assessments; worked with application architects to ensure that security best practices and internal requirements were met through the entire development lifecycle; performed threat modeling, design reviews and code reviews with a focus on security as part of the development lifecycle. I hold a postgraduate degree (Italian "Master“) in Strategic homeland defense: threat intelligence, big data and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure“.</p>

<h3>Software Configuration Management</h3>

<p>I worked as Software Configuration Manager and Build and Release Manager for several clients. I’ve been using Git and Svn and tools such as Bitbucket, ClearCase, Synergy, Jenkins and Ansible, for which I have often developed integration and automation scripts. I know how a change management process works and how to put in place a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment system.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>

<p>I’ve been technically leading small groups of people, reasoning together on solutions to common problems, future developments and prioritizing work. I’ve extensively used Scrum and like to integrate some concepts (like the standups, the backlogs and the sprints) also in contexts using a rigid waterfall approach. I know how to use tools such as JIRA or Microsoft Azure DevOps.</p>

<h3>Processes And Standards</h3>

<p>I’ve been working for quite a few years in highly regulated industries, especially those adopting the ISO 26262 standard (for automotive applications) and the IEC 62304 standard (for medical devices). I have a thorough knowledge of the V cycle and understand its tailoring to specific industry contexts. I also had some exposure to MIL-STD-498 and Common Criteria ISO 15408.</p>

<p>For a detailed curriculum and happy clients' recommendations, take a look at my <strong><span style="color: #000000">Linked</span><span style="background-color: #0077b5;color: #ffffff">in</span> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felicetufo" target="_blank">profile</a></strong> (and please feel free to connect).<p>

<h2>How I work</h2>

<p>I work from my office in Bologna (Italy), using all the available technologies to keep in touch with my clients and going on-site only when it's really necessary (less costs, more time to focus on the real work).

<p>Whenever possible, I prefer to work with a fixed-price contract: since a thorough analysis of the requirements is needed before starting, this type of contract makes it possible to optimize costs and time, being both the client and I focused on the project goals from the beginning. I'll listen to the specific needs and requirements of your project, analyze them and establish a delivery date (or multiple milestones). If you don't have clear requirements or feel like they can change along the way, that's ok too: let's split the long-term project into smaller short-term projects and prioritize them, beginning to work on known knowns.</p>

<p>I can also work under a time and material contract: in this case I usually propose a hourly rate, which may vary depending on a number of factors such as the project duration, the requested time commitment (full-time, part-time, ...), the responsibilities (sw developer, sw architect, project manager...), etc.</p>
